            "Epic Fight Arena" is a PvP-focused Minecraft server built around the Epic Fight mod, which overhauls Minecraftâ€™s combat mechanics by adding complex fighting styles and animations. The mod brings a more action-oriented, "soulslike" combat experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            In our server players can engage in intense PvP battles using different classes, special attacks, and unique abilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            The server itself offers various game modes, including KitPvP, where players can pick pre-set kits with unique gear and abilities, Battle Royale, King of The Hill, and many more.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's tailored for players who enjoy tactical combat with additional depth, from managing stamina during battles to utilizing different fighting strategies depending on their class or weapons.
